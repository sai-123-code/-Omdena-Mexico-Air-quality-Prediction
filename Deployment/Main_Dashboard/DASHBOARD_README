The code in repository implements a dynamic Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring and visualization system for Mexico, using libraries like Streamlit, Folium, and Pandas. 
Here's an overview of the purpose and functionality of the major components:

# Main Features

## Main Dasboard (Main_landing_page_custom.py):

This Python script, built using Streamlit, serves as the foundation for creating an interactive and customizable dashboard interface. 
It is the central component of the application, providing the structural backbone for user navigation, 
sidebar functionality, filters, and more. 
The file establishes a modular base to incorporate additional pages or features seamlessly.



## AQI Overview (Page_1.py):

Provides a summary of AQI and pollutant levels for a selected station or all stations.
Displays AQI status (e.g., Good, Moderate, Hazardous) with a color-coded banner.
Shows pollutant levels like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 using Streamlit metrics.
Displays a table summarizing AQI data and traffic congestion indices for stations.

## Interactive Map (Page_2.py):

Embeds the heatmap in the Streamlit app using Streamlit-Folium.
Uses Folium to generate an AQI heatmap with data from various monitoring stations.
Displays AQI data as:
A heatmap overlay where color intensity corresponds to AQI levels.
Custom markers for each station, with color-coded icons based on AQI levels.
Offers a "Refresh Map" button to reload real-time AQI data.

## Data Handling (data_handlers.py):

Manages loading AQI data from an Excel file.
Retrieves real-time AQI data for the current hour.
Provides utility functions to fetch station coordinates and names.

## Multilingual Support (language_utils.py):

Translates static text and station names into English and Spanish based on user preferences.
